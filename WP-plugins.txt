Plugins that are NOT Slow or Resource Hogs

Lightweight Plugin Alternatives

    SEO – Rank Math (remember to disable unused modules).
    Backups – UpdraftPlus.
    Comments – native comments.
    Sliders – Soliloquy or MetaSlider.
    Gallery – Gutenberg Gallery or Meow Gallery.
    Analytics – Google Analytics + Google Search Console (ideally no plugins).
    Social Sharing – Grow Social is a fast social sharing plugin with less requests.
    Theme/Page Builder – GeneratePress, Blocksy, Kadence, Oxygen, or Genesis.
    No plugin – many things can be coded manually. Coding your header/footer in CSS instead of page builders, disabling Heartbeat, limiting autosaves/post revisions, etc.

WP-Optimize shows which plugins add the most database overhead. For example, I saw modules from Rank Math were adding lots of bloat, so I disabled those I didn’t need. You may also find old plugin tables in your database, in which case you’ll see a “remove” button where you can delete the table using WP-Optimize. This happens when you install/delete plugins a lot.

Forms => It’s an embedded form from Dubsado, otherwise Gravity Forms and WP Forms are both good.

Security => Cloudflare Firewall. Can also try Limit Login Attempts, Two-Factor, and Blackhole For Bad Bots.
